# Intro  
## Instructor's Note  
"*This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing*   
*data. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling*  
*commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical*  
*models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or*  
*sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by*  
*the data. We will cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as*  
*some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics.*   
*We will also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques*   *used to visualize high-dimensional data.*  
  
*All the best,*  
  
*Roger Peng*"
